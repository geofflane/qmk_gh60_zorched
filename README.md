Zorched GH60 Layout
=====================

## Quantum MK Firmware
For the full Quantum feature list, see the parent readme.md.

* Mac layout of alt/cmd
* WASD and VIM (hjkl) arrow keys on second layer
* Standard ANSI layout with Pok3r styled function layers
* ESC key led enables when on function layer
* Lockable layer with arrow keys on WASD with backlighting to indicate locked on arrow layer

### Additional Credits
Keymap has been based on robotmaxtron's layout.


### TODO

* Can probably remove some more of the RGB stuff for those of us who didn't programm underglow on an add-on board
